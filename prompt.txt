In the reference folder you will fine the html file that was built to help with programming a broadlink device. 
In my case it is a rm4 pro. 
This html page uses the HA api to communicate with an updated broadlink comonent based on the original with the added feature to list learned commands. 

YOu can find that code in the reference folder as well. 

What I want to do now is create the same functionality as an add-on instead of the stand along web page -> HA api (custom component).

The basic broadlink add-on supports the learning of commands.
I want to replace the need for an extended version of the broadlink component by adding the functionality to list learned commands to the basic add-on. Refer to the broadlink_plus component code to see how it's done.

I am fine with the new add-on being based on the html file in the reference folder. We should be able to do away with the url and token fields.

I do understand that this add-on will require ro access to config/.storage to list learned commands.

Can you help me create this add-on?
